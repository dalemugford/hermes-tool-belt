# Changelog

All notable changes to Hermes Tool Belt are documented here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
project uses CalVer (`YYYY.M.D` with an optional prerelease suffix).

## [Unreleased]

The initial public capabilities of the plugin:

### Added

- **Cache-aware session freezing.** Under prefix-cache-friendly providers,
  the selected tool set stays stable across normal turns. Model-requested
  expansion is the explicit cache-breaking exception.
- **Cache-off per-turn narrowing.** Under cache-off providers, the tool set is
  narrowed per turn, where re-selection carries no cache penalty.
- **`expand_tools` recovery.** A meta-tool that restores tools mid-session on
  demand, by category or by tool name, with fuzzy suggestions for near matches.
- **Deterministic policy and trigger shaping.** A hand-curated policy
  (`policy.yaml`) resolves the per-scope loadout from always-on tools and
  intent triggers, with no model call in the hot path.
- **Learned between-session shaping.** An optional overlay promotes and demotes
  tools for future sessions from real `expand_tools` evidence and is applied
  only when `learned_mode` enables it.
- **Telemetry, analyzer, and savings reporting.** Append-only telemetry records
  every narrowing decision; the analyzer summarizes usage and reports token
  savings with an optional A/B baseline cohort.
- **Fail-open behavior.** Any internal failure leaves the original Hermes tool
  set fully available.
- **Strict `platform_toolsets` ceiling.** The plugin only narrows within, and
  restores from, the operator's configured ceiling; it never admits
  unsanctioned tools.
